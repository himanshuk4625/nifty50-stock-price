# Nifty50-Price-Prediction-Analysis
The Nifty 50 Stock Price Project involves the development of a predictive model to forecast the stock prices 
of the companies listed in the Nifty 50 index.
## Objective- 
The goal of the project is to leverage historical stock price data and apply machine learning techniques to 
make accurate predictions of future stock prices.
## The project typically involves the following steps.
### Data Collection:
Gathering historical stock price data for the Nifty 50 companies from reliable sources as yahoo finance. This data includes the date, opening price, high price, low price, closing price, adjusted closing price, and trading volume.
### Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and preparing the collected data for analysis.
### Feature Engineering: 
Creating additional features from the available data that may enhance the predictive power of the model. This can include calculating technical indicators, such as moving averages.
Splitting the Data: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to build and train the predictive model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
### Model Selection: 
Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the prediction task. Commonly used algorithms for stock price prediction include linear regression recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

### Model Training, Evaluation & Prediction: 
Training the selected model on the training dataset, Assessing the performance of the trained model by evaluating its predictions on the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics include mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.Using the trained model to make predictions of future stock prices based on new or unseen data. 
## Conclusion- 
The Nifty 50 Stock Price Project aims to provide insights and tools for investors, traders, and financial professionals to make informed decisions based on predicted stock prices. It enables stakeholders to assess potential risks, identify investment opportunities, and optimize their trading strategies in the dynamic stock market environment.
